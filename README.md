## Features

- Keyboard Accessibility by making `/` as the default search focus key
- Graceful Degradation, showing a Pokemon Not Found on invalid Pokemon input
- Shuffle Pokemons on every page load using [`array-shuffle`
  ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/array-shuffle)
- Using Bootstrap as the component library (it's not dead yet XD)
- Using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for build and optimizations
